# What is Coding Trainer?

Coding trainer is a project to encourage me to code more rather than putting it aside to play games.

# What does it do?

The plan is to have a background monitor so when you open any game, game clients or specified programs, the application will be forcefully closed and a warning will pop up, such as "No games, you must code for 2 more hours"

# This sounds familiar

This was inspired the Oasis fitness trainer in the book, Ready Player One. Where Wade had to do a certain amount of exercise daily to enable access to the Oasis, in the end he became healthier and fitter. My plan is to get better at coding by using this idea.

# Can I help?

Of course, either fork or email me at Info@IronPhreak.com

I welcome any suggestions and ideas


# Disclaimer

Please bare in mind, I'm still new to coding (hense why I need this to encourage me more to learn) so they'll be mistakes and inefficient ways to achieve things.
