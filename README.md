# What is Coding Trainer?

Coding trainer is a project to encourage me to code more rather than putting it aside to play games.

# What does it do?

The plan is to have a background monitor so when you open any game, game clients or specified programs, the application will be forcefully closed and a warning will pop up, such as "No games, you must code for 2 more hours"

# This sounds familiar

This was inspired the Oasis fitness trainer in the book, Ready Player One. Where Wade had to do a certain amount of exercise daily to enable access to the Oasis, in the end he became healthier and fitter. My plan is to get better at coding by using this idea.

# Can I help?

Of course, either fork or email me at Info@IronPhreak.com

I welcome any suggestions and ideas


# Disclaimer

Please bare in mind, I'm still new to coding (hense why I need this to encourage me more to learn) so they'll be mistakes and inefficient ways to achieve things.

# Coding-Trainer UI

- [ ] Credits will be earned hourly (Determine how many per hour)
- [ ] Credits can then be used to unlock something of particular desire
- [ ] User earns credits per hour
- [ ] Add more options to 'File'
- [ ] Add more to 'Help'
- [ ] Add more menus?
- [ ] Populate white box with programs running currently
- http://doc.qt.io/qt-4.8/qprocess.html
- http://www.bogotobogo.com/Qt/Qt5_QListView_QStringListModel_ModelView_MVC.php
- [ ] Allow user to select the programs in white box
- Can be done by adding a drop down box, refer to bogotobogo link
- [ ] Connect C# with Qt somehow? Or change the framework completely?

Programs required
<br><br>Qt\Qt5.7.0\...\qtcreator.exe
<br><br>To begin working on this program download from this website
<br>https://www.qt.io/download-open-source/#section-2
<br>It is imperative that you have MinGW or some C compiler or this program is rendered useless.
<br>Another approach is downloading the Qt Designer and working on the UI seperate from the Code.
<br>The only setback is that there will be no inter connected talking between the *.ui *.cpp and *.h files
